## 2. Installation & Technical Setup

Follow these steps to integrate Pagora POS into your Laravel application.

### A. Repository Configuration

Since Pagora POS is distributed via a private repository, you must first register our server in your `composer.json` file:

```json
"repositories": [
		{
				"type": "composer",
				"url": "https://pagorapos.creator.ianstudios.id"
		}
]
```

### B. Authentication & Licensing

Before pulling the package, authenticate your environment. Replace the placeholders with the credentials provided upon purchase:

```bash
composer config http-basic.pagorapos.creator.ianstudios.id license YOUR_LICENSE_KEY
```

### C. Retrieve Package

Download the package via Composer. This will pull the latest stable version from our private registry:

```bash
composer require ianstudios/pagorapos
```

### D. Install

Run the automated installation command. This handles migrations and populates (eg: product and category) :

```bash
php artisan pagorapos:install
```

### E. Asset & Configuration Deployment

Pagora POS requires specific assets and configurations to be published to your host application:

```bash
# Publish core configuration
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=pagorapos-config

# Publish assets
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=pagorapos-assets

# Publish localization files
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=pagorapos-translations
```

### F. Tailwind CSS Integration

To ensure the POS Terminal renders correctly with its custom UI, you must add the package paths to your `tailwind.config.js`:

```javascript
export default {
    content: [
        './resources/**/*.blade.php',
        './vendor/filament/**/*.blade.php',
        // IMPORTANT: Add the package view path
        './vendor/ianstudios/pagorapos/resources/views/**/*.blade.php', 
    ],
}
```

### G. Compile Assets (NPM Build)

After updating the Tailwind configuration, you **must** recompile your assets to include the Pagora POS UI:

```bash
# Install dependencies (if not already)
npm install -D tailwindcss@3 autoprefixer postcss

# Build assets for production
npm run build
```

*Note: Ensure your `npm run build` process completes without errors to guarantee all UI colors are visible.*

### H. Register the Plugin

Open your Filament Panel Provider (e.g., `app/Providers/Filament/AdminPanelProvider.php`) and register the **PagoraPosPlugin**:

```php
use Ianstudios\PagoraPos\PagoraPosPlugin; // Import the plugin

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        ->default()
        // ... other configurations
        ->plugins([
            PagoraPosPlugin::make(), // Add this line
        ]);
}
```

## User Model Configuration

To enable API access (required for the POS Terminal and data synchronization), you must add the `HasApiTokens` trait to your `User` model.

Ensure that **Laravel Sanctum** is installed, then open your `app/Models/User.php` file:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Models;

// 1. Import the Sanctum Trait
use Laravel\Sanctum\HasApiTokens; // [!code ++]
use Illuminate\Notifications\Notifiable;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Auth\User as Authenticatable;

class User extends Authenticatable
{
    // 2. Add the trait to the class
    use HasApiTokens, Notifiable; // [!code ++]

    /**
     * The attributes that are mass assignable.
     *
     * @var array<int, string>
     */
    protected $fillable = [
        'name',
        'email',
        'password',
    ];

    // ...
}
```

Note: If you are using a custom model, you can configure your User model class in `config/pagorapos.php`

Note: If you haven't installed Sanctum yet, please run: 

```bash
composer require laravel/sanctum

php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Laravel\Sanctum\SanctumServiceProvider"
```
